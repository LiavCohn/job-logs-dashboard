# Job Logs Dashboard

A full-stack web application for analyzing and visualizing job log data, featuring a dashboard with filters, metrics, charts, and an AI chat assistant for job log analysis.

---

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Filter job logs by date, client, and country. View metrics, deltas, outliers, and trends.
- **Charts**: Visualize job statistics and trends using interactive charts.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Ask questions about your job logs using natural language (powered by Groq's API).
- **Pagination & Sorting**: Easily navigate and sort large datasets.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Material-UI and Recharts for a modern, mobile-friendly experience.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** (v9+ recommended)
- **MongoDB** (local instance required)
- **Groq API Key** ([Get one here](https://console.groq.com/keys))

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-logs-dashboard.git
cd job-logs-dashboard
```

### 2. Set up and Activate Local MongoDB
**NOTE** 
- There is a remote database dedicated to this demo. If you wish to skip this step + the import of the data, please make sure you have this on the .env file:
```MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://liavcohen955:9GowzfHMcrR29NcW@cluster0.ppk3ago.mongodb.net```

This project is configured to work with a **local MongoDB instance only** by default.

- **Install MongoDB Community Edition:**
  [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

- **Start the MongoDB server:**
  ```sh
  mongod
  ```
  This launches the MongoDB server process on the default port (27017). **You must leave this running in a terminal window while using the app.**

- *(Optional)*: Open a MongoDB shell to inspect your database:
  ```sh
  mongosh
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  mongo
  ```
  This opens an interactive shell for manual inspection or debugging, but is **not required** to run the app.

### 3. Backend Setup

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/boston_assignment OR the remote address
PORT=5000
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

- Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key ([get one here](https://console.groq.com/keys)).
- The default `MONGODB_URI` is for local MongoDB only.

#### Import Data (REQUIRED)

Before running the backend, you **must** import the job log data into your local MongoDB:

```sh
node scripts/importData.js
```

Wait for the script to finish before continuing.

#### Start the Backend Server

```sh
npm start
```
The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### 4. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window/tab:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

---

## Usage

- Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
- Use the dashboard to filter, sort, and analyze job logs.
- Open the AI Chat Assistant page to ask questions about your job data.

---

## Notes

- **API Key Security:** Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to version control.
- **MongoDB:** Ensure MongoDB is running locally before starting the backend.
- **Data Import:** You must run the import script before using the app.
